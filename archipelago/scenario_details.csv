1,First Contact,"River Surges in Sunlight, Lightning's Swift Strike, Shadows Flicker Like Flame",(none),,(none),,Brandenburg-Prussia,Standard,Use Blitz default scenario,"Dahan have been part of the island's life for a long time. So long, in fact, that some spirits don't remember a time without them. As such, the arrival of new Dahan, in strangely shaped ships, is at most a mild surprise to spirits of the island. It is only when they start building, unexpectedly fast, that spirits realise there's something different about them. Those are not Dahan at all - they are something completely different, and much more damaging.

River Surges in Sunlight, first, realises the threat. Hurriedly, it contacts nearby spirits. Vital Strength of the Earth, calmly sleeping, barely responds. Luckily, two other spirits are faster to react: Shadows Flicker Like Flame, and Lightning's Swift Strike.","The invaders' ships are still visible on the horizon. They may be keeping their distance right now, but there is little doubt in any one spirit's mind: they will be coming back. On a common accord, they decide to work together to rouse Vital Strength of the Earth and ask it to lend a hand.",Scenario #81

Yet unable to speak to each other, spirits had to seek new ways of communicating with one another.","Stone's Unyielding Defiance now being supported by two spirits down from the heavens, Vital Strength of the Earth expresses a desire to go back to its own island, where it is desperately needed. Before it leaves, however, Stone's Unyielding Defiance offers this in thanks: to guide it to a location on the island where old artifacts are bound to make Vital Strength of the Earth significantly Mightier.
In the meantime, Shattered Days Split the Sky offers to seek the single piece of Sunshine that fell from the impact: it is bound to come in helpful, especially to a certain River spirit.",Scenario #44 and #84
3,Bring Beasts Forth,"A Spread of Rampant Green, Bringer of Dreams and Nightmares",(none),,Sharp Fangs Behind the Leaves,,England,Fragment,Additional victory condition: have a beasts token and the presence of either spirit in every jungle.,"A spirit of fangs and claws, with a sharp scent. One who sees in the dark, and can hear a noise from miles away. Surely, such a spirit would know of the object Bringer of Dreams and Nightmares spoke of. Usually, it lurks within luxuriant jungles...","A dark, sultry voice emerges from somewhere Behind the Leaves. Dahan are often blind to anything that is not directly in front of them, but beasts may scout the land and find much more than meets a human's eye. Certainly, beasts could seek those objects... Alas, there are spirits below the surface, within the flowing water and hiding within jungle leaves, and they do not always welcome such inquisition. Who knows how they may react?",Scenario #88
4,ASPECT of Wind,(none),"Finder of Paths Unseen, Lightning's Swift Strike",Wind,All other spirits,,Russia,Standard,"Use Powers Long Forgotten default scenario.
Additional loss condition: invaders discover all sources of power.
Spirits do not benefit from the first source of power they find.","Some legends say the Pathmaker can open up portals, linking two places as though they were adjacent. Others believe the Pathmaker has no such ability; instead, it moves as swiftly as the Wind from one place to the next, carrying spirits and Dahan on its wings. Perhaps both are true?
We know that Lightning's Swift Strike and the Pathmaker had a long conversation, though we do not know what was said. Somehow, as the spirits were seeking the source of power that brought them together, everything around them seemed to become more frantic...","As the search progressed, everything in the island seemed to accelerate: Dahan and invaders, beasts and wilds. The land itself evolved more rapidly, healing from its wounds faster than usual. Even after Lightning's Swift Strike's departure, the island seemed to stay on this unnaturally accelerated tempo.","If you won during your first game, unlock Lightning's Swift Strike's Wind aspect.

5,The Plantation Colony,"Grinning Trickster Stirs Up Trouble, Downpour Drenches the World, Many Minds Move as One",(none),,(none),,France,Standard,Use Guard the Isle's Heart default scenario,"On a South-Western island of the archipelago, a new kind of invader is reaching the coasts: one interested in turning the island into a plantation colony. To do so, they have brought other invaders, against their will, and are having them work in their place. Such a situation is unstable at best, and when such a metaphorical powder keg is placed nearby, there is bound to be a spirit to provide a match...","Seldom has Grinning Trickster Stirs Up Trouble seemed so invested in the island's defense. When it suggests to Downpour Drenches the World and Many Minds Move as One to help aspect-seeking spirits as it defends the island, the other two agree without hesitation: Downpour Drenches the World is delighted at the prospect of another rain-dance with Lightning's Swift Strike, and who knows what goes on in those Many Minds?","Scenario #19, #30 and #92"
6,Stalker of Hidden Secrets,"A Spread of Rampant Green, Sharp Fangs Behind the Leaves, Bringer of Dreams and Nightmares",(none),,Thunderspeaker,,England,Standard,Use Rituals of Terror default scenario.,Such a spirit as the Stalker of Hidden Secret is not easily found... and finding it does not mean that it will be willing to share any information. Yet it is the best chance of finding an answer. Bringer of Dreams and Nightmares suggests an offering of sorts - an opportunity for an acute spirit to see glimpses of the invaders' innermost fears: a valuable currency for some spirits.,"Stalker of Hidden Secrets does not so easily reveal itself, but the Ritual does not go unrewarded: as the last Ritual is being performed, all spirits share a vision, in which invaders of all origins strike bargains with Hearth-Vigil. As part of this bargain, Hearth-Vigil whispers rumours of objects of immense power hidden within the bowels of the earth. The invaders' eyes widen with greed. What they seek is a magic that would make them invulnerable!",Scenario #96
7,BENEATH THE ARCHIPELAGO: Memorabilia,(none),Stone's Unyielding Defiance,,Volcano Looming High,,Sweden,Standard,"Use Powers Long Forgotten default scenario
WARNING: Loss will result in the end of this side story.","There is no convincing Volcano Looming High to help any further; if anything, its anger threatens to put an early end to the spirits' quest. It did, however, point them in the right direction: if the Serpent's prison is made out of Stone, then perhaps a spirit of Stone would be willing to lend a hand. Perhaps somewhere under the earth, there is a key to freeing the long-imprisoned spirit.","Nobody, not even Stone's Unyielding Defiance, could have expected what followed: from the bottom of the sea, an entire island emerged. On it, beasts and Dahan were already well-established, apparently unaware of the watery ceiling they lived under for all those years. The island appears to be pulsating from a majestic energy, sure sign of the might of the spirit Slumbering Beneath.","If you won (either during your first or second game), unlock Scenario #70"
8,An Ocean Away,"River Surges in Sunlight, Ocean's Hungry Grasp, Thunderspeaker",(none),,"Lightning's Swift Strike, Vital Strength of the Earth, Shadows Flicker like Flame",,Sweden,Standard,(none),"River Surges in Sunlight crossed the archipelago, seeking the help of a kindred spirit from the watery depths: Ocean's Hungry Grasp. Nowhere to be found on the high seas, and nowhere to be found in the deep caves where it occasionally lurks; River Surges in Sunlight ultimately finds it oddly closer to shores. However, this is quickly explained as ships appear on the horizon. In the sky, a thunderous roar echoes as Ocean's Hungry Grasp chortles in satisfaction: today, its hunger may yet be sated.","Help, explains Ocean's Hungry Grasp, cannot be provided, as already it is providing assistance to Thunderspeaker. The ocean can be everywhere at once, but its hunger has limits, and no storm lasts forever. It is empty-handed that River Surges in Sunlight comes back to its original island.",Scenario #14
9,Field Experience,Stone's Unyielding Defiance,Starlight Seeks its Form,,Fractured Days Split the Sky,,Habsburg,Fragment,Use Rituals of the Destroying Flame default scenario,"One is not only defined by one's will: events also come into play. As such, Starlight Seeks its Form was invited to partake in the defense directly, for words and demonstrations cannot compare with direct experience. It is a risky decision, as invaders are already protected by their own rituals and Hearth-Vigil's blessing, but it is bound to be a defining moment of the new spirit's existence.","As the protection surrounding the invaders start to fade away once more, spirits are hailed by the Pathmaker, bearing news: spirits from all over the archipelago are gathering to discuss events relevant to them all. It is said that Many Minds Move as One bears news for those who can understand it; and that the very future of the archipelago may hang on the outcome of this meeting.",Scenario #80
10,A Second Barrier,"Keeper of the Forbidden Wilds, Thunderspeaker, Ocean's Hungry Grasp",(none),,(none),,Sweden,Standard,Use rituals of terror default scenario.,"Invaders are still fighting against the wall that has been erected before them, buying a bit of time for spirits to plan and discuss. It is agreed that their next step should be to seek out Hearth-Vigil, but none knows where it is.
As the spirits discourse, an increasingly high number of eyes spy upon them from the nearby jungle. A deep, sultry voice emerges from Behind the Leaves: if Hearth-Vigil helps the invaders, then surely it is among them that they should seek.
Spirits consider this advice: it is sensible, however none of them have much contact with the newcomers.
Oh, but there is one who can help, continues the voice Behind the Leaves. On an island South of here. Only, its help may not come cheap...
Spirits ponder upon this, and eventually agree to go and seek that spirit's help. Before leaving, they agree to perform another ritual, an additional layer of protection, for the wards they put on the shores will not last eternally.
Behind the Leaves, the spirit Grins.","Spirits prepare to depart, with the exception of Keeper of the Forbidden Wilds, duty-bound to the island.
As you travel, it says, consider crossing the Deepest Wilderness and reaching the Highest Volcano. There, you will find a child of Green and Fire. Should we need any additional help, consider waking it up. Be careful, however, as it is still young and carefree, and it may do more harm than good.",Scenario #62 and #67
11,Survival Instinct,(none),"Vengeance as a Burning Plague, Shroud of Silent Mist",,All other spirits,,Scotland,Opposite Shores,Use Dahan Insurrection default scenario.,"Vengeance as a Burning Plague and Shroud of Silent Mist continue their work of destruction. Desperate for their survival, Dahan, believing their salvation cannot come as long as invaders are present, are growing increasingly agitated. In an attempt to calm the spirits of destruction, they decide to do their best to rid the island of invaders altogether.","Invaders may have taken a blow, but already new ships appear on the horizon. Mist and Plague do not falter, and Dahan are growing desperate. Thankfully, help is on the horizon",Scenario #72
12,AFFINITY - Spirits of Kinship with Dahan,(none),"Thunderspeaker, Grinning Trickster Stirs Up Trouble",,All other spirits,,France,Standard,Use Despicable Theft default scenario,"Quit following me! shouts Thunderspeaker.
Oh? it answers. But if I left, who would tell you about the Spirit-Speaker who made a deal with invaders, and is currently offering them various baubles forged by your very hands?
This has better not be another one of your trick, grumbles Thunderspeaker as it rushes toward the nearby Dahan encampment.","Among Dahan, there is something of a saying: be careful when calling spirits for help. The Thunderspeaker may answer, if you are lucky. If you are not, it may answer still, but will have a few too many eyes.","If you won during your first game, reveal Artifact #23 and Artifact #39.

Use Elemental Invocation default scenario","Invaders had a bit of time to prepare, and have decided to try to stand fast against the spirits. By now, however, the elements themselves have been alerted by the spirits' intend, and are willing to lend a hand.","As spirits celebrate their victory, their attention is drawn to the very centre of the island, where a battle of a different nature is taking place.",Scenario #87

River Surges in Sunlight shares Ocean's Hungry Grasp's refusal, and Shadows Flicker Like Flame mentions the cryptic rumour among the Dahan, concerning a new strategy adopted by the invaders. Surprisingly, Lightning's Swift Strike remains quiet and contemplative, very much unlike its usual demeanour.
The spirits have little time to contemplate their next steps: already, a new wave of invaders is pouring it. This time, they seem especially curious, and especially drawn to the centre of the island. While the meaning of this behaviour eludes them, the spirits are certain of one thing: the invaders must not reach that which they seek.","The question floats in the air, remaining unanswered: what were the invaders seeking? As there is no point in asking a question when it is clear no answer can be provided, all spirits abstain. It is in this silence that Lightning's Swift Strike speaks, describing what it saw high up in the Shattered Sky: different aspects of themselves, taking the shape of old objects charged with ancestral power, hidden beneath the earth. (Rephrase) Hidden, and awaiting the day they would surface again. In those ancient objects may lie the answer to their predicament.

Spirits agree: some of them would have to stay on the island, defending it as best they can, while others may go on a search of those objects, hoping to alter the course of events in their favour.","Reveal Flag #1, Flag #2 and Artifact #19.

15,To Save A Dahan's Life,Volcano Looming High,Thunderspeaker,,"Vengeance as a Burning Plague, Shroud of Silent Mist",,Sweden,Standard,Use Ward the Shores default scenario.,"Volcano Looming High cares little for the content of the gathering: two spirits of destruction are loose on its island, and while it is usually the one being known for causing widespread destruction, this time the destruction is out of its control - and out of control in general.
Most spirits do not care much for Volcano Looming High's alarm: aren't invaders destroying islands all over the archipelago?
Thankfully, one of them agrees to help, for the sake of the Dahan that are dying every day. Thus an uneasy truce is formed between the Volcano that caused a great many Dahan's deaths and their champion.
Of course, before leaving, Thunderspeaker insists on raising protections to its own island, so Dahan and other spirits may defend it in its absence.","Who knows what could remain of the island since Volcano Looming High left? Hurried and dreadful, the spirits hurry back.",Scenario #72
16,A Dwindling Flame,"Lure of the Deep Wilderness, Shifting Memory of Ages, Finder of Paths Unseen",(none),,(none),,Russia,Standard,Use Rituals of the Destroying Flame default scenario,"The barrier surrounding the island is not fully erected, and invaders are still circumventing it with ease. As spirits regroup, they notice that the Sun is burning bright in the sky: sure sign of a Ritual happening.","Spirits manage to scare invaders away, but a few stay behind, hypnotized by Lure of the Deep Wilderness. Individual invaders escape notice more easily than large groups, and who knows how the ritual is going to affect the powerful appeal of the Deep Wilderness?",Scenario #20
17,To interact with a Web of Souls,(none),"Many Minds Move as One, Bringer of Dreams and Nightmares",,All other spirits,,England,Fragment,Use A Diversity of Spirits default scenario,"Weaves a Web of Souls is not difficult to find: it is, after a fashion, ubiquitous, as long as there are beings that are part of the Web of Souls. Interacting with it, however, is not easy: it is necessary to be able to understand beings formed of multiple minds, and the complex individuality of each of those minds. Many Minds Move as One knows this, and sought one who could help it in this interaction... and when it comes to understanding invaders' innermost thoughts and dreams, it is not difficult to know who to call.","Communication is not easy, and definitely not straightforward, but before long, Many Minds Move as One achieves something like an understanding of Weaves a Web of Souls' intentions. It also learns of the recent events in its own island, for the dreams of invaders are soon filled with promises of invulnerability. Many Minds Move as One departs in a hurry: whatever it has learned will have to wait.",Scenario #94
18,"A Lone, Unyielding Spirit",(none),"Stone's Unyielding Defiance, Vital Strength of the Earth",,All other spirits,,Habsburg,Standard,Use Rituals of the Destroying Flame default scenario,"The invaders' newfound invulnerability scared most spirits away, fleeing and regrouping elsewhere. On a lone island on the Southmost point of the archipelago, only a handful of spirits and Dahan remained: Dahan unwilling to abandon the island on which they were born and raised, or yet unaware of the invaders' magic. Among the remaining spirits, most were small enough to go by unnoticed, or were already siding with the invaders; only one decided to stay and face the invaders heads-on, Unyielding to the last. It called for all the help it could get, hoping that its sibling, if nobody else, would hear it and come to support its resistance.","Stone and Earth working in unison are remarkable adversaries, and by working together, they managed to fend off the first wave, though only at great cost.

Come, cross the archipelago, join me, let us unleash the elements upon this island, and let us dance the night away!","The spirits' dance unleashed chaos on an unprecedented scale. Down below, on the island, there is nothing but confusion and uproar. It looks as though entire parts of the island are joining in the dance, shifting and moving to accompany the spirits, and Dahan, invaders and beasts are brought along, thoroughly confused as the island revolves around them.","If you won during your first game, unlock Lightning's Swift Strike's Pandemonium aspect.

Spirits, as Dahan, can be prey to violent emotions, even spirits as odd as Lure of the Deep Wilderness. Upon seeing them depart, it flew into a rage, deploying every tool in its arsenal to ensure such happenstance would never, ever happen again.","During this time, the Pathmaker was nowhere to be seen: last minute coordination efforts were to be made to arrange for the gathering of all spirits... and invaders are still coming to the island, Lured ever inward.",Scenario #23

As Downpour Drenches the World and Many Minds Move as One approach smaller spirits to make amends, they realise there is one missing: Grinning Trickster Stirs Up Trouble is nowhere to be seen. Hopefully it went back to defend the rest of the island, which had already been left unattended for quite some time.","Spirits large and small eventually come to an uneasy agreement.

Upon learning of trouble on other islands, they take a quick decision: River Surges in Sunlight offers to seek the help of a long-time ally living further away from the shores; whereas Lightning's Swift Strike takes it upon itself to warn as many spirits as possible throughout the archipelago.","Scenario #8, #29 and #83"

This explains much: the fear of a small group of invaders is offset by the greed of all those left behind, now shared through a Web of Souls.

This, explains Many Minds Move as One with many beaks and many muzzles, has been their strength so far, and will also be their downfall.
Stalker of Hidden Secrets saw a fragment of Will-Be when Moon and Sun collided, and that knowledge echoed in time, in such a way that it was aware of the arrival of the invaders long before the first sail emerged on the horizon. Armed with such knowledge, it approached Hearth-Vigil and Weaves a Web of Souls with a plan:
For the invaders to leave and never come back, it would not be sufficient for a small group of invaders to be pushed away; their tales of horror would only amuse courageous explorers back where they came from, and inevitably, more would follow, again and again, until spirits ultimately fail to protect the island. However, if there was a way for those invaders, comfortably safe back home, to feel the fear and despair of those who came to the island, then hopefully, they would stop coming.
Hearth-Vigil gave the invaders the drive and courage to go to the island in droves, while Weaves a Web of Souls gathered as many invaders as it could in its Web. Now that the Web is large enough, all it would take to send the fear reverberating all the way to the invaders' home country would be a massive blow, affecting all invaders at once: a feeling that they are not welcome anywhere past their borders, for as long as they plan on colonizing new lands.
Stalker of Hidden Secrets reveals the location of an island near the archipelago, one unknown to spirits and sparsely inhabited by Dahan, that invaders used as a stepping stone to the rest of the archipelago. This is where spirits must now go, in a coordinated movement, to defend their island.

WARNING: Loss will result in the end of this side story.","Few spirits were there from the beginning. Ocean's Hungry Grasp itself may have existed, but it wasn't prowling around. The Pathmaker is older than most, but it only started visiting the island once beasts migrated there. The oldest among all spirits to still be active today is probably Volcano Looming High. Maybe an offering to the mountain-spirit would put it in a good mood, and it would be inclined to share a few stories on the origin of the island?","According to its account, Volcano Looming High had many younger siblings, back then. They alone were standing tall above the ocean. One day, a Serpent came by, and tired of swimming, asked to rest upon their backs. They generously offered him a place to rest, but the Serpent soon became hungry. With nothing to eat for miles around, the Serpent decided to eat the smallest among them, and after having fed, it grew larger. As it grew, so did its hunger, so the Serpent ate the second smallest island. Once again, it grew, became hungry, and started eating all the islands
one after the other, from the smallest to the largest. In order to protect itself and its remaining siblings, Volcano Looming High decided to cast a veil of smoke in the eyes of the Serpent. Blinded and furious, the Serpent decided to protect itself by wrapping the earth around itself. When it did so, Volcano Looming High quickly turned the earth into a prison of stone, forever locking the Serpent beneath the archipelago.","If you won (either during your first or second game), unlock Scenario #7."

WARNING: Loss will result in the end of this side story.","Keeper of the Forbidden Wilds had spoken of another spirit, a child of the Volcano and the Green, sleeping somewhere on the archipelago. To reach it, spirits would first have to cross the Deepest Wilderness. This is a place odd spirits call their home; a place as enticing as it is alien... and dangerous, even for spirits. Visitors would be hard pressed to say whether the spirits residing in this environment are trying to help or hamper them. Regardless, to find the one they are looking for, they will have to go in...","Reaching the Deep Wilderness was the easy part; leaving it is another problem altogether. Spirits make their way, confident in the direction they chose, only to find themselves back where they started after hours, sometimes days. Mountains seem to shift place on the horizon; rivers change their course to confuse them, and jungles keep promising oh so plentiful rewards!

Invaders only interested in settling in go for easier to reach shores; those are interested in something different: it is said that the greatest among beasts dwell deep within the island, and it is the appeal that have Lured them so Deep.
Of spirits there are few: the first and most prominent being, of course, Lure of the Deep Wilderness, comfortable in this recluse kingdom. Beside it, Finder of Paths Unseen is known for passing by on its way to one destination or the next; the centre of the island is often one of its preferred routes. Finally, Shifting Memory of Ages has chosen those islands as its home, possibly because the islands, shielded from the ever-changing outside world, remind it of something it used to know, a long time ago...","Invaders still seek something deep within the island. Perhaps they hope to reinstate the ritual that gave them invulnerability, thinking that the second time around, it will work permanently, instead of working on rare occasions. Perhaps they have decided on a new ritual. Perhaps they h ave something else in mind entirely. Their objective is of little consequence: the destruction they cause along the way is alarming enough to convince most spirits that they must leave as soon as possible.",Scenario #37

Certainly, something worth seeing. And what of this Thunderspeaker the Dahan are often speaking about? Perhaps it could help as well...","The aftermath of the confrontation is bloody, and there is nothing but sorrow on Thunderspeaker's human-looking face. As Shadows Flicker Like Flame approaches it, it speaks, its voice roaring like Thunder. It speaks of the arrivals of invaders, here too, at the other end of the archipelago. It speaks furiously, and as it speaks, the sky darkens. Shadows Flicker Like Flame leaves with more questions than answers.",Scenario #22
65,The Story of the Moon that Was Angry at the Sun,"Vital Strength of the Earth, Stone's Unyielding Defiance",Fractured Days Split the Sky,,Starlight Seeks its Form,,Habsburg,Coastline,Use The Great River default scenario.,"As the story goes, the Sun stayed up in the sky, unrelenting for two entire months. The Moon became offended with the Sun's presence, and in an attempt to take back its rightful place in the sky, it decided to ram itself into the Sun. The Sun is bigger and brighter than the Moon, so upon impact, the Moon shattered to pieces, while the Sun only lost a single beam of Sunshine. However, the impact was enough to push the Sun back over the horizon, and the Moon managed to get back its place in the Sky. It is said that since then, the Moon spends its time seeking pieces of itself and gathering them to become whole again, only to lose them over the course of the next few weeks and having to seek them all over again, repeating this cycle for ever and ever.
On the day of the impact, the story tells us that the entire Sky was Split, and the two celestial bodies, markers of time, Fractured the Days themselves. Pieces of Might-Have-Been flew back, in the Sky that Was, and there, caught Lightning's Swift Strike's attention, teaching it of the aspects it could take. Pieces of Will-Be flew back as well, and it is believed that it is Stalker of Hidden Secrets who managed to catch them.
On that day, invaders lost their invulnerability, though it is believed that they remembered a way to bring it back, only during daytime, and only for smaller groups.
As for Stone's Unyielding Defiance and Vital Strength of the Earth, they were trying to push back increasingly large groups of invaders when the Sky Fractured, and unexpected help came to their support.","The Sky kept on shaking from the impact for numerous weeks. It is said that a piece of Starlight, unable to hold on to the heavens, fell all the way down to the archipelago, in farmland almost entirely abandoned to the invaders. Were it not from Stone's Unyielding Defiance, it certainly would have dissolved.
New to the archipelago and the world as a whole, the newly formed spirit had little time to find its bearing before a new wave of invaders emerged on the horizon.",Scenario #2

Spirits do not benefit from the first source of power they find.","Lure of the Deep Wilderness' help is like none other: it is a bizarre spirit, with whom it is hardly possible to communicate. For this reason, perhaps, it was perfectly suited to help Shadows Flicker Like Flame: in an alien way, they understood each other.
As invaders abandoned their post to travel ever-inland, those who stayed behind started feeling distraught. As their Shadows started Flickering, this feeling evolved to become Foreboding.","It is not always easy to measure a spirit's influence. In their battle against invaders, some spirits smash houses and ships; other spirits let vines and beasts go wild. How would one measure the importance of the day when invaders decided to step away from the island without any bloodshed, solely because they were confident something terrible would happen if they were to step foot on the island?","If you won during your first game, unlock Shadows Flicker Like Flame's Foreboding aspect.

Help?, it says. Oh, help can be provided. However, the Dahan - no, the invaders - oh, honestly, pretty much all other local spirits - have left this place quite a mess, and help cannot be provided until the island is back to a more orderly state. Would the spirits be so kind as to help clean up the island?
As soon as the spirits agree, the oddly large Dahan disappears, leaving them alone with the task of cleaning up the island.

If the spirits of destruction cannot be calmed down, they may be directed to a more helpful direction. See if it would not be possible to track down what has been stolen, and bring it back. Destruction will be welcome in this endeavour.
To start, the best thing to do may be to interrogate the Sun itself.","As the story goes, invaders stole some of the Sun's clothes, and wore it to approach the island; this was the source of their invulnerability.

There has to be a more permanent solution...
Spirits exchange ideas, argue, and seek solutions. Some want to teach the invaders, other believe destruction is the only way. As they discuss, invaders are once again looming on the horizon.
No permanent solution has yet been found, but perhaps a temporary one would buy them a bit more time? River Surges in Sunlight mentions a ritual to ward the shores, perhaps solving the problem of invaders for a time.","The magical barrier set in place seems to hold, at least for the time being. Spirits take a brief moment to celebrate their victory, but this celebration is short-lived: their island is large, and they did not ward all shores. By the look of it, invaders have already found another way in.",Scenario #22
91,AFFINITY - Temperamental Spirits of the Earth,(none),"Volcano Looming High, Stone's Unyielding Defiance",,All other spirits,,Sweden,Standard,Use A Diversity of Spirits default scenario,"According to some legends, Stone's Unyielding Defiance is Volcano Looming High's younger sibling. According to some others, Stone's Unyielding Defiance is a child of the Volcano. Others claim they are actually one and the same spirit, appearing under different incarnations. The one thing all stories agree upon is that Volcano Looming High and Stone's Unyielding Defiance are some of the most temperamental and unwavering spirits on the entire archipelago.
Both are extremely quarrelsome, so it does not come as a surprise when, forced to collaborate in the face of invaders, they keep communication with one another to a minimum.","Surrounded by badlands, afraid of the angry Volcano and unable to turn the Stony land into fertile grounds, invaders are bound to turn back, defeated.","If you won during your first game, reveal Artifact #41 and Artifact #20.

Additional loss condition: invaders discover all sources of power.
Spirits do not benefit from the first source of power they find.","Many Minds Move as One does not communicate like other spirits; to most, it is an alien entity, whose motives are incomprehensible. Some believe it does not have the capacity for intelligent thought, and it is no smarter than the individual beasts that compose it, but they are wrong. In this case, its different mode of existence is an asset, as it allows it to communicate with Shadows Flicker Like Flame on a level few would understand.","Both spirits took shape in an instant, gathered where they were needed, sought what they were after, and disappeared as soon as their work was done without leaving a trace. Dahan that were present at the time still wonder whether any of it really happened, or if they simply imagined it all.","If you won during your first game, unlock Shadows Flicker Like Flame's Amorphous aspect.

Ignore normal winning conditions. Instead, you win if invaders need to draw from the Invader Deck, but the deck is empty (this would normally be a losing condition)","Recall is not an exact science, and sometimes, it is necessary to seek for a long time to find memories that are buried deep under the years. However, spirits are confident. It is just a matter of buying enough time for Shifting Memory of Ages to recall...","It is the island itself!
Shifting Memory of Ages is radiant: it remembered.
The island itself is a spirit, that of a colossal Serpent. If they manage to wake it up, such a fantastic spirit is bound to shift the balance in their favour.",Scenario #16 and #61.

Dahan who remember the Years of the Relentless Sun fear the worst. Crops are withering, and if not from the clouds brought forth by Downpour Drenches the World, famine would already be upon them. When invaders arrive on the coast once again, Dahan quickly realise that something has changed: invaders appear invulnerable, as the stories predicted. Without supernatural intervention, it won't be long before the invaders claim the entire archipelago as their own.","Spirits managed to scrounge up a defense to push back the invaders, but only at a great cost. Still, this proves that invaders are not as invulnerable as they claimed to be. With a mix of exhaustion and relief, spirits prepare for the arrival of the next wave of invaders, now more confident and better prepared.","Reveal Flag #7, Flag #8 and Artifact #27.

Spirits do not benefit from the first source of power they find.","Beasts gave reports of a great many objects, and there is no way to tell which ones are useful, and which ones are useless. However, the arrival of Shadows Flicker Like Flame confirms one thing to all present: there is definitely an aspect here, just waiting to be uncovered. Whether it is wise to let a mad Shadows Flicker Like Flame upon the archipelago is another question entirely...","There are more artifacts to uncover, but this will have to wait: unleashing Madness upon the island is not without consequence. Dahan and beasts appear completely out of control, and Shadows Flicker Like Flames is now nowhere to be seen. In addition to that, a new wave of invaders is looming on the horizon.","If you won during your first game, unlock Shadows Flicker Like Flame's Madness aspect.

In the heart of every invader, greed and fear are conflicting, and it is up to the spirits to ensure fear dictates their action.","By now, both invaders and Dahan have taken massive losses, and the land bears scars of the confrontations. The situation cannot go on for long, otherwise the island will remain blighted forever.

As the story goes, Rituals of Terror were created millenia ago by Serpent Slumbering Beneath the Island and Finder of Paths Unseen, long before the archipelago was ever formed. They originally meant to help other living beings come to terms with their own mortality, but they quickly discovered that death is an uneasy subject to bring up with beings of limited life span, and by presenting the subject too directly, the result is often pure terror.","Other legends challenge the origin of the Ritual, and claim that it is much more recent, and was created by Shadows Flicker Like Flame and Bringer of Dreams and Nightmares, in response to the invaders' presence. Could both be true?","If you won during your first game, reveal Artifact #5, Artifact #49 and Flag #15.

It is said that it feels at home there. Could it be that the spirit of retribution and anger actually enjoys Heart of the Wildfire's presence, for no reason other than the latter's pleasant disposition? Or does the firestorm that constantly surrounds it have more to do with it? One way or another, when the invaders decide to leverage the powers of the Destroying Flame to their advantage, those spirits feel compelled to react - after all, this is their province.",Invaders are bound to have learned a lesson on this day: play with fire; get burned.,"If you won during your first game, reveal Artifact #1 and Artifact #37.

Additional Victory Condition: There is at most 1 land per board with invaders.","Vengeance as a Burning Plague and Shroud of Silent Mist understand each other instinctively. They are spirits of vengeance and death, and are hell-bent on destruction. As Volcano Looming High ponders upon the situation, they do not hesitate, unleashing their fury against Dahan and invaders equally.","Distraught with the way events turned, Volcano Looming High decides to seek help. Only, which spirit would be available? They have all gathered far away.

During the fast phase, Volcano Looming High may perform the Ritual of Awakening if is is able to reach the 2nd / 3rd / 4th threshold for its Explosive Eruption innate power, and spirits collectively pay 4 / 6 / 10 energy, for the first / second / third Ritual.

WARNING: Loss will result in the end of this side story.","Volcano Looming High considers the request of the approaching spirits, and decides to help: given the situation, it is time to awaken the Heart of the Wildfire. Volcano Looming High prepares to call its child, sending a message so loud the entire archipelago will hear it.","Volcano Looming High's calls echoes throughout the archipelago, and all around, the land seems to combust.

101,Spirits of Passion and Life,(none),"A Spread of Rampant Green, Volcano Looming High",,All other spirits,,England,Standard,Use Varied Terrains default scenario.,"It is said that Volcano Looming High used to have siblings, which it lost. Its grief lasted for centuries, until one days it met a spirit so full of life that it could not help but be drawn to it. This spirit of Green life itself drew the moody Volcano from its grief and offered it the possibility to create life anew.","The land itself celebrated their union, and from this unlikely alliance, a spirit as Wild as fire came to be - but this is another story altogether.","If you won during your first game, reveal Artifact #62 and Artifact #69.

However, Spirit-Speakers know which spirits have their best interest at heart. When two spirits closest to the Dahan encourage them to take arms and mobilise, they do not hesitate.","Few spirits go out of their way to look after Dahan' interests. In turn, few Dahan go out of their way to look after Spirits' interests. However, in some rare occasions, a strong bond between the two is formed, and few can withstand the strength of such an alliance.","If you won during your first game, reveal Artifact #26 and Artifact #65.

103,Spirits of Bounded Influence,(none),"Ocean's Hungry Grasp, Lure of the Deep Wilderness",,All other spirits,,Habsburg,Standard,Use A Diversity of Spirits default scenario,"Most spirits develop affinities by interacting with one another. However, there are some exceptions. Sometimes, there is an odd alliance being formed when spirits agree on borders so well defined that they can work in complement, without ever interfering with one another. Such is the case of Ocean's Hungry Grasp and Lure of the Deep Wilderness: they will never cross each other's path, and in this, they both find satisfaction.","Coasts have always belonged to Ocean's Hungry Grasp, and anything deeper inland is Lure of the Deep Wilderness' domain. On this point, both spirits agree. In this repartition, however, there is no room left for invaders.","If you won during your first game, reveal Artifact #45, Artifact #59 and Artifact #70.

You lose the game if the island ever becomes blighted.,"Not so long ago, before invaders' sails appeared on the horizon, Stone's Unyielding Defiance did not appear so Unyielding, and Vengeance as a Burning Plague was more often than not fast asleep, to the relief of most inhabitants of the archipelago.
It is only recently that the two spirits found common ground, in a shared will to repel the invaders and make them pay for the damage they caused.","From this unexpected alliance, one can take heart: for all the damage the island may have taken, it is still healthy, and before long, it will recover from the fallout of the invasion.","If you won during your first game, reveal Artifact #16 and Artifact #61.
If you won during your second game, only reveal Artifact #61."

They often go unnoticed, and when Dahan notice them, they often speak of them in hushed voices, for it is widely believed that it is best to avoid drawing their attention. Those spirits do not belong anywhere near humans; they rarely bring anything good with them.","Of the events that transpired on the island when Shroud of Silent Mist and Many Minds Move as One joined forces, no story will ever be told.

In this, Shifting Memory of Ages' approach is rather rare: few spirits choose forgetfulness. 
It is therefore a bittersweet moment when Serpent Slumbering Beneath the Island greets its Ages-old friend, only to be met with a look of confusion. 
Perhaps some relics of the past can revive a Memory that is long gone?","There is a moment of recollection, and for a time, both spirits exchange and celebrate as if no time had passed at all. As they separate, Serpent Slumbering Beneath the Island savours the moment, knowing that it will have been forgotten before they meet again.","If you won during your first game, reveal Artifact #30 and Artifact #63.

If you win, play a second time with the Second Wave default scenario. This game is only considered won if you won both times. The adjustment to adversary level specified in the Second Wave default scenario is only temporary; as such, Adversary Level should go up by a total of 1, not 2, after both games have been played.

If you lose either games and replay the scenario as a second attempt, you have to win both games once again.

Spirits cannot be unlocked or mastered during this scenario.","The world is always full of wonders in the eyes of a newborn. Heart of the Wildfire spends most of its time sleeping, and rarely gets to experience it, whereas Starlight Seeks its Form has not yet lived for a full year. Who could blame them for trying to explore and discover as much of it as they can?","Spirits run around the island in a joyful spirit of discovery. Are they pushing back invaders on purpose, or is it just an unexpected consequence of their happy rummage?","If you won both your first game and the Second Wave, reveal Artifact #43 and Artifact #48.

108,Spirits from Another Realm,(none),"Bringer of Dreams and Nightmares, Finder of Paths Unseen",,All other spirits,,Brandenburg-Prussia,Standard,Use Dahan Insurrection default scenario,"The Pathmaker has a Realm of its own, bordering our own. In this Realm, odd beings live. Though most of them care little for our world, some are part of Dahan' lives, for better or worse. One among the most prominent is certainly Bringer of Dreams and Nightmares.
On occasions, Dahan will ask their Spirit-Speakers: In a Realm so distant, do spirits ever have any impact on our worlds? Why do we pay them any mind?. Often, Spirit-Speakers will respond with the story of one very specific insurrection, which was aided by those spirits from another realm...","Some Dahan doubt spirits were actually involved at all in the insurrection. Certainly, there were much less present than, say, Thunderspeaker, and their effort was much less visible. Yet when invaders loom on the horizon, numerous Dahan will catch themselves dreaming of another insurrection aided by spirits from a different realm.","If you won during your first game, reveal Artifact #52 and Artifact #66.

Most Dahan never dare venture this far, and those that do never come back to tell the tale. However, Sharp Fangs Behind the Leaves is no Dahan, and it calls those jungles its home. There is a truce between the hunting spirit and the Keeper: the hunting spirit may come and go as it pleases, as long as it holds its tongue regarding what it saw - and to this day, it never uttered a word.","Invaders are more foolhardy than Dahan, and old folk tales of dangers deep within the jungles do not sway them. They are another cautionary tale in the making.","If you won during your first game, reveal Artifact #40 and Artifact #55.

Grinning Trickster Stirs Up Trouble starts with Fire in the Sky minor power.

All spirit effects that should destroy invaders push them instead, similar to Bringer of Dreams and Nightmares' special rule. 
At the beginning of the Ravage step, all invaders take damage equal to their attached strife tokens. This may destroy an invader before it deals damage.","Numerous stories recount a wager that was held between Grinning Trickster Stirs Up Trouble and Downpour Drenches the World. Details of the wager are unclear and vary from one storyteller to the next, but its impacts are very clear: chaos on a scale unequaled to this day.","It is said that the expression Architects of their own Destruction came to be after the aforementioned events. It is also said that all spirits of the archipelago, big and small, agreed to never let those two wager anything together ever again.","If you won during your first game, reveal Artifact #64 and Artifact #68.

Those stories forget about Lightning's Swift Strike, which can alone, in an instant, Split the Sky to stormy pieces. Who knows what may unfold from the exchanges Lightning and Sky have, so far up above? Perhaps they learn of events up there that are yet to unfold?",Do they forget what they learn when they come down to the island? Is Will-Be replaced by Might-Have-Been long before they reach the ground? This would certainly explain why so many of Lightning's Swift Strike's requests seem nonsensical to Dahan...,"If you won during your first game, reveal Artifact #15 and Artifact #36.

112,Spirits of Renewal and Vitality,(none),"River Surges in Sunlight, Vital Strength of the Earth",,All other spirits,,Scotland,Standard,Put 2 additional blight tokens on the blight card. You lose if the island ever becomes blighted.,"Most spirits are focused on pushing back the invaders; few pay attention to what may come next. River Surges in Sunlight and Vital Strength of the Earth are among the few that focus on reconstruction: in partnership with Dahan, they work in protecting, cleaning, and revitalising the island. Together, they embody hope for a better future.","Among confusion and confrontations, a surprisingly large number of spirits and Dahan alike take heart in knowing that there are some among them who work to build a better tomorrow.","If you won during your first game, reveal Artifact #22 and Artifact #46.
If you won during your second game, only reveal Artifact #22."
